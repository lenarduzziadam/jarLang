# Declaration / immutability tests for Jarlang
# Save as tests/declaration_test.pot
# Expected behavior (manual):
# - `vow` declares a constant; reassigning should raise InterpreterError
# - `sacred` declares a sacred variable; reassigning should raise InterpreterError
# - `wield` declares a normal variable; reassignment should succeed

# 1) vow (constant) - reassignment should fail
vow x 10
# The following reassignment SHOULD cause an InterpreterError in a proper runner
x = 20

# 2) sacred - reassignment should fail
sacred s "hello"
# The following reassignment SHOULD cause an InterpreterError in a proper runner
s = "bye"

# 3) wield (normal) - reassignment should succeed
wield y 5
# reassign to a new value
y = 7
# print to verify value
chant y

# End of declaration tests
